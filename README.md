This repository is the companion to my thesis titled "A Comparison of Time Series Methods for Post-COVID Transit Ridership Forecasting"

In this repository, I have listed the packages in R needed to reproduce the results of my thesis, including the time series models, time series forecasts, time series plots, forecast plots, seasonal plots, and residuals. Alternatively, my hope is that these functions may help you produce your own time series forecasts.

I have left comments in the functions to help guide you.
